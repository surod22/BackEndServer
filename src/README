Assumptions 
Word definition:
-no digits
-no , or . or space

Problem 1: 
Return type: Integer
I assume a word is not going to have 
decimal length, therefore I take the floor of the avg. 


To run: 
Go inside project directory and do the following
mvn package
mvn compile           //compile code, build dependencies
mvn spring-boot:run   //run server and leave it running to run curl command 

Open seperate tab
curl -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json" -d "{'text':'My cat is gray. It doesn\'t have feathers.'}" http://localhost:8080/words/avg_len
